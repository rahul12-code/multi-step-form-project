## Overview

### The Challenge

This project is a multi-step form where users can:

- Complete each step of the form sequence seamlessly.
- Navigate back to previous steps to update their inputs.
- View a summary of their inputs on the final step and confirm their submission.
- Experience a responsive interface that adapts to different screen sizes.
- Interact with hover and focus states for all clickable elements.
- Receive form validation messages when:
  - A required field is not filled.
  - An email address is incorrectly formatted.
  - A step is submitted without any input.

## My Process

### Built With

- **HTML5** and **CSS3** for structure and styling.
- **JavaScript** for dynamic functionality and DOM manipulation.
- **Tailwind CSS** framework for efficient and responsive design.
- **Mobile-first workflow** for improved accessibility and user experience.

### What I Learned

This project provided significant insights into the following:

- **Tailwind CSS**: Leveraged utility-first classes to quickly style components, enhancing design efficiency.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Managed multiple steps dynamically by updating the DOM as the user navigates through the form.
- **Form Validation**: Implemented real-time validation for required fields, email formatting, and step submissions.

### Continued Development

Future improvements and areas to focus on include:

- Incorporating `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` to save form progress.
- Implementing an API integration to handle form submissions.
- Exploring advanced frameworks like React for state management in multi-step forms.

### Useful Resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - An excellent resource for understanding and utilizing Tailwind utilities.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - Provided detailed information about DOM manipulation and form validation.
- [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - Helped with writing clear and concise markdown documentation.
